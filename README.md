# 📝 AI Action Item Extractor: Meeting Dialogue to JSON.

### Project Overview
Goal: Build a specialized AI model that reads meeting dialogues and extracts action items into a clean, structured JSON format.
### Value Proposition:
Transforms unstructured meeting conversations into actionable, trackable tasks.
Eliminates manual note-taking and follow-up confusion.
Demonstrates advanced NLP and structured output generation skills.

This project transforms unstructured meeting dialogues into perfectly structured, actionable tasks. By fine-tuning and comparing two powerful language models (**Mistral-7B** and **Phi-4**), this system extracts tasks, owners, and deadlines, outputting them into a clean, machine-readable JSON format.

### 🔍 The Problem: The High Cost of Unproductive Meetings

Every professional has felt it: meetings that end with ambiguous takeaways and tasks that fall through the cracks. This isn't just an annoyance; it's a massive drain on productivity. Key action items are often lost in messy notes or verbal-only agreements, leading to confusion, missed deadlines, and wasted resources.

**Our Solution:** An intelligent system that listens to the conversation and provides a definitive source of truth for all action items, ready for integration into any project management workflow.

### 🚀 Live Demo: From Chaos to Action

Give the model a raw meeting transcript...

**Input Dialogue:**
```text
#Person1#: Hey team, let's sync on the Q3 report.
#Person2#: I can take the lead on gathering the sales data. I'll have it done by Friday.
#Person1#: Great, thanks Alex. Maria, can you handle the marketing metrics?
#Person3#: Sure thing. I'll get those to you by end of day Thursday.
```

...and get a perfectly structured JSON output.

**Generated Output:**
```json
{
  "action_items": [
    {
      "owner": "Alex",
      "task": "Gather sales data for Q3 report",
      "deadline": "by Friday"
    },
    {
      "owner": "Maria",
      "task": "Provide marketing metrics for Q3",
      "deadline": "end of day Thursday"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 🌟 Model Showdown: Mistral 7B vs. Phi-4

A head-to-head comparison reveals a clear trade-off between raw power and nimble efficiency.

| Feature                       | 🔵 Mistral-7B (Fine-Tuned)      | 🟢 Phi-4 (Fine-Tuned)           |
| -----------------------       | ----------------------------     | ---------------------------- |
| ✅ **JSON Validity**         | **100%** (Perfectly reliable)    | 90.0% (Excellent)            |
| 🎯**F1-Score** (Accuracy)    | **0.92** (High precision)        | 0.87 (Very strong)           |
| ⏱️ **Avg. Latency** (Colab T4 GPU) | ~22.7 seconds                    | **~4.2 seconds** (5.4x faster) |
| 💾 **Adapter Size**          | ~26 MB                           | ~28-40 MB                    |
| 🏆 **Best For**              | Critical, high-stakes tasks      | Real-time, speed-sensitive applications |

**Key Takeaway**: **Mistral-7B** is the champion for accuracy and reliability. **Phi-4** is the top choice for applications where speed is paramount.

### 🧠 How It Works: The Technical Architecture

This project leverages state-of-the-art techniques for efficient model customization.

#### 1. Core Technology: QLoRA Fine-Tuning
Instead of training multi-billion parameter models from scratch, we use **QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation)**.

```python
# The key to memory efficiency
bnb_config = BitsAndBytesConfig(
    load_in_4bit=True,
    bnb_4bit_quant_type="nf4",
    bnb_4bit_compute_dtype=torch.bfloat16,
    bnb_4bit_use_double_quant=True,
)
```
This method loads the base model in 4-bit precision and only trains small, injectable "adapter" layers, reducing memory footprint by over 99% and making it possible to train on a single consumer GPU.

#### 2. Fine-Tuning Workflow
The process is simple, robust, and repeatable.

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Raw Dialogue] --> B{Prompt Template};
    B --> C(Fine-Tuned LLM);
    C --> D[Generated Response];
    D --> E((Structured JSON));
```
